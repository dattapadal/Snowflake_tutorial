# Snowflake_tutorial
This repo contains all my Snowflake practice queries that I have executed using trial Enterprise edition.

These sql queries are built based on the exercises given in "[Snowflake SnowPro Core Certification Study Guide by Hamid Mahmood Qureshi](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/snowflake-snowpro-core/9781119824442/)". 

Feel free to provide feedback or tips/corrections if any.

Thanks
